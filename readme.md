# Microservices and Development of AI-Based Microservices

## What are Microservices?

**Microservices** is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, loosely coupled, and independently deployable services. Each microservice focuses on a specific business capability and communicates with other services through well-defined APIs. This approach contrasts with monolithic architecture, where the application is built as a single, unified unit.

### Key Characteristics of Microservices

- **Modularity**: Each service is designed to perform a specific function and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
- **Scalability**: Services can be scaled individually based on demand, improving overall system scalability.
- **Flexibility**: Different services can use different technologies and programming languages best suited for their functionality.
- **Resilience**: Failures in one service do not necessarily impact the entire system, improving fault tolerance and reliability.
- **Continuous Delivery**: Independent services enable faster deployment and iteration cycles.

### Benefits of Microservices

- **Improved Agility**: Teams can work on different services simultaneously without affecting others.
- **Easier Maintenance**: Smaller codebases are easier to understand, test, and maintain.
- **Technology Diversity**: Services can use different technologies or frameworks, optimizing for specific requirements.
